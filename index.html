        <div>After taking an Intro to Coding class, I realized I wasn’t on the track I thought I wanted to be on, so I started looking at other programs. I found the UX degree plan and after some thorough research about what UX design even was, it sounded like something right up my alley. I switched my degree plan the following semester.</div>
