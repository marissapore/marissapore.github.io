	<h5>Developing a new financing app for millenials</h5>

  <img class="cs-img" src="../../images/oody-hifi.png">

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>Our team is beginning to develop a financial budgeting app after conducting a competitive analysis of current financial apps, defining the vision of our product, and validating our identified assumptions.</p>

  <h3>My Budgeting Experience</h3>
  <p>I tried a number of different apps to assist me track my spendings, but I could never actually stick to using them. I finally found one that I don’t mind using, but it’s still lacking in what I’m looking for in a budgeting app. I have friends that share the same frustrations with budgeting apps, so we decided to make our own.
  </p>

  <h3>The Team</h3>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Tech Lead</li>
    <li>Developer</li>
    <li>UX Lead (me)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Intro to oody</h3>
  <div class="two-column-container">
    <img src="images/oody-dailybudget.png">
    <div>
     <p>This is an app that makes managing your finances suck slightly less.</p>
     <p>Once you enter your income, expenses, and how much you want to save, oody calculates your daily allowance of what you can afford to spend.</p>
     <p>Whatever you don’t spend rolls over to the next day.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
  <div class="labeled-img">
    <img src="images/competitors.png">
    <label>After researching a number of current financial apps and conducting a thourough heuristic analysis, this is a breakdown of the top three I have identified</label>
  </div>

  <h3>Identifying Assumptions</h3>
  <p>Before we began forming hypotheses regarding design solutions, it was necessary to declare our assumptions up front and test those that present the highest risk.</p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>There are young people that want to manually track their finances as opposed to an automated solution, but they don't know where to start</li>
    <li>Budgeting can be intimidating for those that don't already</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Research</h4>
  <ul class="list">
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-jan_brookings-metro_millennials-a-demographic-bridge-to-americas-diverse-future.pdf#page=4"><li>There are over 75 million millenials in the US, making up nearly a quarter of the population</li></a>
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/simester/Public/Papers/Alwaysleavehome.pdf"><li>People tend to spend more money when they pay with a card</li></a>
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.aicpa.org/press/pressreleases/2016/saving-is-a-top-priority-for-millennials.html"><li>2 in 3 millenials admit impulse spending keeps them from achieving their financial goals</li></a>
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.finra.org/newsroom/2014/finra-foundation-study-finds-millennials-struggle-financially"><li>Millennials display low levels of financial literacy, engage in problematic financial behaviors, and express concerns about their debt</li></a>
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/959385532/files/doc_downloads/research/2016-Millennials-and-Money-Research-Report.pdf"><li>67% of millenials that don’t save money say they can’t afford to</li></a>
  </ul>

  <h4>Conclusions</h4>
  <p>I found people who find value in setting a budget have success by doing it either manually, or with software that automates it for them. There are many free, automated money-saving apps, but the ones that promote their users to take control can be pricey for those with a low income&mdash;it seems likely there may be a link between habitual overspending, and lack of awareness of one's entire financial situation. On top of that, there is a large number of young people who don't budget because they don't believe it will be beneficial.</p>
  <p>A critical factor of success for oody is to educate our potential users on the benefits of personally managing a budget.</p>

  <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
  <div class="labeled-img">
    <img src="images/valueprop.png">
    <label>Living document of research findings that guides the vision and goals of oody</label>
  </div>

  <h3>Product Vision</h3>
  <p>oody will give young people a fun, easy way to keep track of their finances</p>

  <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
  <p>We believe that building this solution will allow young people to become more cognizant of their spendings, and reduce the pains of budgeting</p>
  <p>We will know we are successful when our users are continuously logging their transactions</p>
